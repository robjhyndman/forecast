  * Another bug fix in auto.arima(). Occasionally the root checking would cause an error. The condition is now trapped.

Version 1.13 (16 June 2008)
  * Bug in plot.ets() fixed so that plots of non-seasonal models for seasonal data now work.
  * Warning added to ets() if the time series contains very large numbers (which can cause numerical problems). Anything up to 1,000,000 should be ok, but any larger and it is best to scale the series first.
  * Fixed problem in forecast.HoltWinters() where the lower and upper limits were interchanged.

Version 1.12 (22 April 2008)
  * Objects are now coerced to class ts in ets(). This allows it to work with zoo objects.

  * Yet more bug-fixes for auto.arima().

Version 1.11 (8 February 2008)

Version 1.09 (11 December 2007)
  * A new argument “restrict” has been added to ets() with default TRUE. If set to FALSE, then the unstable ETS models are also allowed.
  * A bug in the print.Arima() function was fixed.

Version 1.08 (21 November 2007)
  * AICc and BIC corrected. Previously I had not taken account of the sigma^2 parameter when computing the number of parameters.
  * arima() function changed to Arima() to avoid the clash with the arima() function in the stats package.
  * auto.arima now uses an approximation to the likelihood when selecting a model if the series is more than 100 observations or the seasonal period is greater than 12. This behaviour can be over-ridden via the approximation argument.
  * A new function plot.ets() provides a decomposition plot of an ETS model.
  * predict() is now an alias for forecast() wherever there is not an existing predict() method.
  * The argument conf has been changed to level in all forecasting methods to be consistent with other R functions.

  * The following methods for Arima objects were added: summary.

  * Bug fix in summary of in-sample errors. For ets models with multiplicative errors, the reported in-sample values of MSE, MAPE, MASE, etc., in summary() and gof() were incorrect.
  * ARIMA models with frequency greater than 49 now allowed. But there is no unit-root testing if the frequency is 50 or more, so be careful!
  * Improvements in documentation.

Version 1.06 (15 June 2007)
  * Bug fix in auto.arima(). It would not always respect the stated values of max.p, max.q, max.P and max.Q.
  * The tseries package is now installed automatically along with the forecasting bundle, whereas previously it was only suggested.

Version 1.05 (28 May 2007)
  * Introduced auto.arima() to provide a stepwise approach to ARIMA modelling. This is much faster than the old best.arima().
  * The old grid-search method used by best.arima() is still available by using stepwise=FALSE when calling auto.arima().
  * Automated choice of seasonal differences introduced in auto.arima().
  * Some small changes to the starting values of ets() models.

  * Added MASE to gof().
  * croston() now returns fitted values and residuals.

  * This version is the first to be uploaded to CRAN.

Version 0.99992 (8 August 2006)
  * Corrections to help files. No changes to functionality.

Version 0.99991 (2 August 2006)
  * More bug fixes. ets now converges to a good model more often.

Version 0.9999 (1 August 2006)
  * Mostly bug fixes.
  * A few data sets have been moved from fma to forecast as they are not used in my book.
  * ets is now considerably slower but gives better results. Full optimization is now the only option (which is what slows it down). I had too many problems with poor models when partial optimization was used. I’ll work on speeding it up sometime, but this is not a high priority. It is fast enough for most use. If you really need to forecast 1000 series, run it overnight.
  * In ets, I’ve experimented with new starting conditions for optimization and it seems to be fairly robust now.
  * Multiplicative error models can no longer be applied to series containing zeros or negative values. However, the forecasts from these models are not constrained to be positive.

Version 0.999 (27 July 2006)
  * The package has been turned into three packages forming a bundle. The functions and a few datasets are still in the forecast package. The data from Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman (1998) is now in the fma package. The M-competition data is now in the Mcomp package. Both fma and Mcomp automatically load forecast.
  * This is the first version available on all operating systems (not just Windows).
  * pegels has been replaced by ets. ets only fits the model; it doesn’t produce forecasts. To get forecasts, apply the forecast function to the ets object.
  * ets has been completely rewritten which makes it slower, but much easier to maintain. Different boundary conditions are used and a different optimizer is used, so don’t expect the results to be identical to what was done by the old pegels function. To get something like the results from the old pegels function, use forecast(ets(…)).
  * simulate.ets() added to simulate from an ets model.
  * Changed name of cars to auto to avoid clash with the cars data in the datasets package.
  * arima2 functionality is now handled by arima() and pegels2 functionality is now handled by ets.
  * best.arima now allows the option of BIC to be used for model selection.
  * Croston’s method added in function croston().
  * ts.display renamed as tsdisplay
  * mean.f changed to meanf, theta.f changed to thetaf, rw.f changed to rwf, seasonaldummy.f to seasonaldummyf, sindex.f to sindexf, and spline.f to splinef. These changes are to avoid potential problems if anyone introduces an “f” class.

Version 0.994 (4 October 2004)
  * Fixed bug in arima which caused predict() to sometimes fail when there was no xreg term.
  * More bug fixes in handling regression terms in arima models.
  * New print.Arima function for more informative output.

Version 0.993 (20 July 2004)
  * Added forecast function for structural time series models obtained using StructTS().
  * Changed default parameter space for pegels() to force admissibility.
  * Added option to pegels() to allow restriction to models with finite forecast variance. This restriction is imposed by default.
  * Fixed bug in arima.errors(). Changes made to arima() meant arima.errors() was often returning an error message.
  * Added a namespace to the package making fewer functions visible to the user.

Version 0.99 (21 May 2004)
  * Added automatic selection of order of differencing for best.arima.
  * Added possibility of linear trend in arima models.
  * In pegels(), option added to allow parameters of an exponential smoothing model to be in the “admissible” (or invertible) region rather than within the usual (0,1) region.
  * Fixed some bugs in pegels.
  * Included all M1 and M3 data and some functions to subset and plot them.
  * Note: This package will only work in R1.9 or later.

Version 0.98 (23 August 2003)
  * Added facilities in pegels.
      o It is now possible to specify particular values of the smoothing parameters rather than always use the optimized values. If none are specified, the optimal values are still estimated as before.
      o It is also possible to specify upper and lower bounds for each parameter separately.
  * New function: theta.f. This implements the Theta method which did very well in the M3 competition.
  * A few minor problems with pegels fixed and a bug in forecast.plot that meant it didn’t work when the series contained missing values.

Version 0.972 (11 July 2003)
  * Small bug fix: pegels did not return correct model when model was partially specified.

Version 0.971 (10 July 2003)
  * Minor fixes to make sure the package will work with R v1.6.x. No changes to functionality.

Version 0.97 (9 July 2003)
  * Fully automatic forecasting based on the state space approach to exponential smoothing has now been added. For technical details, see Hyndman, Koehler, Snyder and Grose (2002).
  * Local linear forecasting using cubic smoothing splines added. For technical details, see Hyndman, King, Pitrun and Billah (2002).

Version 0.96 (15 May 2003)
  * Many functions rewritten to make use of methods and classes. Consequently several functions have had their names changed and many arguments have been altered. Please see the help files for details.
  * Added functions forecast.Arima and forecat.ar
  * Added functions gof and seasadj
  * Fixed bug in plot.forecast. The starting date for the plot was sometimes incorrect.
  * Added residuals components to rw.f and mean.f.
  * Made several changes to ensure compatibility with Rv1.7.0.
  * Removed a work-around to fix a bug in monthplot command present in R v<=1.6.2.
  * Fixed the motel data set (columns were swapped)

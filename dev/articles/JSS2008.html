</h2>
<p>Automatic forecasts of large numbers of univariate time series are
often needed in business. It is common to have over one thousand product
lines that need forecasting at least monthly. Even when a smaller number
of forecasts are required, there may be nobody suitably trained in the
use of time series models to produce them. In these circumstances, an
automatic forecasting algorithm is an essential tool. Automatic
forecasting algorithms must determine an appropriate time series model,
estimate the parameters and compute the forecasts. They must be robust
to unusual time series patterns, and applicable to large numbers of
series without user intervention. The most popular automatic forecasting
algorithms are based on either exponential smoothing or ARIMA
models.</p>
<p>In this article, we discuss the implementation of two automatic
univariate forecasting methods in the package for . We also briefly
describe some univariate forecasting methods that are part of the
package.</p>
<p>The package for the system for statistical computing <span class="citation">( Development Core Team 2008)</span> is available from
the Comprehensive Archive Network at . Version 8.19.0.9000 of the
package was used for this paper. The package contains functions for
univariate forecasting and a few examples of real time series data. For
more extensive testing of forecasting methods, the package contains the
90 data sets from <span class="citation">Spyros Makridakis, Wheelwright,
and Hyndman (1998)</span>, the package contains 24 data sets from <span class="citation">Hyndman et al. (2008)</span>, and the package contains
the 1001 time series from the M-competition <span class="citation">(S.
Makridakis et al. 1982)</span> and the 3003 time series from the
M3-competition <span class="citation">(Spyros Makridakis and Hibon
2000)</span>.</p>
<p>The package implements automatic forecasting using exponential
smoothing, ARIMA models, the Theta method <span class="citation">(Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos 2000)</span>, cubic
splines <span class="citation">(Hyndman, King, et al. 2005)</span>, as
well as other common forecasting methods. In this article, we primarily
discuss the exponential smoothing approach (in Section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:expsmooth}\)</span>) and the ARIMA
modelling approach (in Section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:arima}\)</span>) to automatic
forecasting. In Section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:package}\)</span>, we describe the
implementation of these methods in the package, along with other
features of the package.</p>

</h2>
<p>Although exponential smoothing methods have been around since the
1950s, a modelling framework incorporating procedures for model
selection was not developed until relatively recently. <span class="citation">J. K. Ord, Koehler, and Snyder (1997)</span>, <span class="citation">Hyndman et al. (2002)</span> and <span class="citation">Hyndman, Koehler, et al. (2005)</span> have shown that
all exponential smoothing methods (including non-linear methods) are
optimal forecasts from innovations state space models.</p>
<p>Exponential smoothing methods were originally classified by Pegels’
(1969) taxonomy. This was later extended by <span class="citation">Gardner (1985)</span>, modified by <span class="citation">Hyndman et al. (2002)</span>, and extended again by
<span class="citation">Taylor (2003)</span>, giving a total of fifteen
methods seen in the following table.</p>
<p>Some of these methods are better known under other names. For
example, cell (N,N) describes the simple exponential smoothing (or SES)
method, cell (A,N) describes Holt’s linear method, and cell (A,N)
describes the damped trend method. The additive Holt-Winters’ method is
given by cell (A,A) and the multiplicative Holt-Winters’ method is given
by cell (A,M). The other cells correspond to less commonly used but
analogous methods.</p>

<h3 id="point-forecasts-for-all-methods">Point forecasts for all methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#point-forecasts-for-all-methods"></a>
</h3>
<p>We denote the observed time series by <span class="math inline">\(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n\)</span>. A forecast of <span class="math inline">\(y_{t+h}\)</span> based on all of the data up to
time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_{t+h|t}\)</span>. To illustrate the
method, we give the point forecasts and updating equations for method
(A,A), the Holt-Winters’ additive method: where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the length of seasonality (e.g., the
number of months or quarters in a year), <span class="math inline">\(\ell_t\)</span> represents the level of the
series, <span class="math inline">\(b_t\)</span> denotes the growth,
<span class="math inline">\(s_t\)</span> is the seasonal component,
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_{t+h|t}\)</span> is the forecast for
<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> periods ahead, and <span class="math inline">\(h_m^+ = \big[(h-1) \mbox{ mod } m\big] +
1\)</span>. To use method <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:AMmethod}\)</span>, we need values for
the initial states <span class="math inline">\(\ell_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_{1-m},\dots,s_0\)</span>, and for the smoothing
parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta^*\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. All of these will be estimated
from the observed data.</p>
<p>Equation <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:3-46a}\)</span> is
slightly different from the usual Holt-Winters equations such as those
in <span class="citation">Spyros Makridakis, Wheelwright, and Hyndman
(1998)</span> or <span class="citation">Bowerman, O’Connell, and Koehler
(2005)</span>. These authors replace <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:3-46a}\)</span> with <span class="math display">\[
s_t = \gamma^*(y_t - \ell_{t}) + (1-\gamma^*)s_{t-m}.
\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(\ell_t\)</span> is substituted
using <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:3-44a}\)</span>, we obtain
<span class="math display">\[s_t = \gamma^*(1-\alpha)(y_t -
\ell_{t-1}-b_{t-1}) +
\{1-\gamma^*(1-\alpha)\}s_{t-m}.
\]</span> Thus, we obtain identical forecasts using this approach by
replacing <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:3-46a}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^*(1-\alpha)\)</span>. The modification
given in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:3-46a}\)</span> was
proposed by <span class="citation">J. K. Ord, Koehler, and Snyder
(1997)</span> to make the state space formulation simpler. It is
equivalent to Archibald’s (1990) variation of the Holt-Winters’
method.</p>
<p>Table <span class="math inline">\(\ref{table:pegels}\)</span> gives
recursive formulae for computing point forecasts <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> periods ahead for all of the
exponential smoothing methods. Some interesting special cases can be
obtained by setting the smoothing parameters to extreme values. For
example, if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0\)</span>, the level is
constant over time; if <span class="math inline">\(\beta^*=0\)</span>,
the slope is constant over time; and if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=0\)</span>, the seasonal pattern is
constant over time. At the other extreme, naïve forecasts (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_{t+h|t}=y_t\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>) are obtained using the (N,N) method
with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=1\)</span>. Finally, the
additive and multiplicative trend methods are special cases of their
damped counterparts obtained by letting <span class="math inline">\(\phi=1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sec:statespace">Innovations state space models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec:statespace"></a>
</h3>
<p>For each exponential smoothing method in Table <span class="math inline">\(\ref{table:pegels}\)</span>, <span class="citation">Hyndman et al. (2008)</span> describe two possible
innovations state space models, one corresponding to a model with
additive errors and the other to a model with multiplicative errors. If
the same parameter values are used, these two models give equivalent
point forecasts, although different prediction intervals. Thus there are
30 potential models described in this classification.</p>
<p>Historically, the nature of the error component has often been
ignored, because the distinction between additive and multiplicative
errors makes no difference to point forecasts.</p>
<p>We are careful to distinguish exponential smoothing from the
underlying state space . An exponential smoothing method is an algorithm
for producing point forecasts only. The underlying stochastic state
space model gives the same point forecasts, but also provides a
framework for computing prediction intervals and other properties.</p>
<p>To distinguish the models with additive and multiplicative errors, we
add an extra letter to the front of the method notation. The triplet
(E,T,S) refers to the three components: error, trend and seasonality. So
the model ETS(A,A,N) has additive errors, additive trend and no
seasonality—in other words, this is Holt’s linear method with additive
errors. Similarly, ETS(M,M,M) refers to a model with multiplicative
errors, a damped multiplicative trend and multiplicative seasonality.
The notation ETS(<span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>) helps in remembering the order in
which the components are specified.</p>
<p>Once a model is specified, we can study the probability distribution
of future values of the series and find, for example, the conditional
mean of a future observation given knowledge of the past. We denote this
as <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{t+h|t} = \E(y_{t+h} \mid
\bm{x}_t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_t\)</span>
contains the unobserved components such as <span class="math inline">\(\ell_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_t\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(h=1\)</span> we use <span class="math inline">\(\mu_t\equiv\mu_{t+1|t}\)</span> as a shorthand
notation. For many models, these conditional means will be identical to
the point forecasts given in Table <span class="math inline">\(\ref{table:pegels}\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{t+h|t}=\hat{y}_{t+h|t}\)</span>. However, for
other models (those with multiplicative trend or multiplicative
seasonality), the conditional mean and the point forecast will differ
slightly for <span class="math inline">\(h\ge 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We illustrate these ideas using the damped trend method of <span class="citation">Gardner and McKenzie (1985)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_t = \hat{y}_t =
\ell_{t-1}+b_{t-1}\)</span> denote the one-step forecast of <span class="math inline">\(y_{t}\)</span> assuming that we know the values of
all parameters. Also, let <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t =
y_t - \mu_t\)</span> denote the one-step forecast error at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. From the equations in Table <span class="math inline">\(\ref{table:pegels}\)</span>, we find that <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\label{ss1}
y_t    &amp;= \ell_{t-1} + \phi b_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t\\
\ell_t &amp;= \ell_{t-1} + \phi b_{t-1} + \alpha \varepsilon_t
\label{ss2}\\
b_t    &amp;= \phi b_{t-1} + \beta^*(\ell_t - \ell_{t-1}- \phi b_{t-1})
    = \phi b_{t-1} + \alpha\beta^*\varepsilon_t. \label{ss3}
\end{align}\]</span> We simplify the last expression by setting <span class="math inline">\(\beta=\alpha\beta^*\)</span>. The three equations
above constitute a state space model underlying the damped Holt’s
method. Note that it is an state space model <span class="citation">(Anderson and Moore 1979; Aoki 1987)</span> because the
same error term appears in each equation. We an write it in standard
state space notation by defining the state vector as <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_t = (\ell_t,b_t)'\)</span> and
expressing <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{ss1}\)</span>–<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{ss3}\)</span> as The model is fully
specified once we state the distribution of the error term <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span>. Usually we assume that
these are independent and identically distributed, following a normal
distribution with mean 0 and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, which we write as <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t \sim\mbox{NID}(0,
\sigma^2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>A model with multiplicative error can be derived similarly, by first
setting <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t =
(y_t-\mu_t)/\mu_t\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> is the relative error.
Then, following a similar approach to that for additive errors, we find
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
y_t &amp;= (\ell_{t-1} + \phi b_{t-1})(1 + \varepsilon_t)\\
\ell_t &amp;= (\ell_{t-1} + \phi b_{t-1})(1 + \alpha \varepsilon_t)\\
b_t &amp;= \phi b_{t-1} + \beta(\ell_{t-1}+\phi b_{t-1})\varepsilon_t,
\end{align*}\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
y_t &amp;= \left[ 1    \phi \right] \bm{x}_{t-1}(1 + \varepsilon_t)\\
\bm{x}_t &amp;= \left[\begin{array}{ll}
                        1 &amp; \phi \\
                        0 &amp; \phi
                   \end{array}\right]\bm{x}_{t-1} + \left[ 1
                   \phi
                   \right] \bm{x}_{t-1}
             \left[\begin{array}{l}
                          \alpha\\
                          \beta
                    \end{array}\right]\varepsilon_t.
\end{align*}\]</span> Again we assume that <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t \sim
\mbox{NID}(0,\sigma^2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a nonlinear state space model, which is usually
considered difficult to handle in estimating and forecasting. However,
that is one of the many advantages of the innovations form of state
space models — we can still compute forecasts, the likelihood and
prediction intervals for this nonlinear model with no more effort than
is required for the additive error model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sec:ssmodels">State space models for all exponential smoothing methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec:ssmodels"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are similar state space models for all 30 exponential smoothing
variations. The general model involves a state vector <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_t = (\ell_t, b_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s_t, s_{t-1}, \dots, s_{t-m+1})'\)</span> and
state space equations of the form where <span class="math inline">\(\{\varepsilon_t\}\)</span> is a Gaussian white
noise process with mean zero and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_t = w(\bm{x}_{t-1})\)</span>. The model with
additive errors has <span class="math inline">\(r(\bm{x}_{t-1})=1\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(y_t = \mu_{t} + \varepsilon_t\)</span>. The model
with multiplicative errors has <span class="math inline">\(r(\bm{x}_{t-1})=\mu_t\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(y_t = \mu_{t}(1 + \varepsilon_t)\)</span>. Thus,
<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t = (y_t - \mu_t)/\mu_t\)</span>
is the relative error for the multiplicative model. The models are not
unique. Clearly, any value of <span class="math inline">\(r(\bm{x}_{t-1})\)</span> will lead to identical
point forecasts for <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span>.</p>
<p>All of the methods in Table <span class="math inline">\(\ref{table:pegels}\)</span> can be written in the
form <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:ss1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:ss2}\)</span>. The specific form for
each model is given in <span class="citation">Hyndman et al.
(2008)</span>.</p>
<p>Some of the combinations of trend, seasonality and error can
occasionally lead to numerical difficulties; specifically, any model
equation that requires division by a state component could involve
division by zero. This is a problem for models with additive errors and
either multiplicative trend or multiplicative seasonality, as well as
for the model with multiplicative errors, multiplicative trend and
additive seasonality. These models should therefore be used with
caution.</p>
<p>The multiplicative error models are useful when the data are strictly
positive, but are not numerically stable when the data contain zeros or
negative values. So when the time series is not strictly positive, only
the six fully additive models may be applied.</p>
<p>The point forecasts given in Table <span class="math inline">\(\ref{table:pegels}\)</span> are easily obtained
from these models by iterating equations <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:ss1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:ss2}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t=n+1, n+2,\dots,n+h\)</span>, setting <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{n+j}=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j=1,\dots,h\)</span>. In most cases (notable
exceptions being models with multiplicative seasonality or

the point forecasts can be shown to be equal to <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{t+h|t} = \E(y_{t+h} \mid \bm{x}_t)\)</span>,
the conditional expectation of the corresponding state space model.</p>
<p>The models also provide a means of obtaining prediction intervals. In
the case of the linear models, where the forecast distributions are
normal, we can derive the conditional variance <span class="math inline">\(v_{t+h|t} = \VAR (y_{t+h} \mid \bm{x}_t)\)</span>
and obtain prediction intervals accordingly. This approach also works
for many of the nonlinear models. Detailed derivations of the results
for many models are given in <span class="citation">Hyndman, Koehler, et
al. (2005)</span>.</p>
<p>A more direct approach that works for all of the models is to simply
simulate many future sample paths conditional on the last estimate of
the state vector, <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_t\)</span>. Then
prediction intervals can be obtained from the percentiles of the
simulated sample paths. Point forecasts can also be obtained in this way
by taking the average of the simulated values at each future time
period. An advantage of this approach is that we generate an estimate of
the complete predictive distribution, which is especially useful in
applications such as inventory planning, where expected costs depend on
the whole distribution.</p>

<p>In order to use these models for forecasting, we need to know the

parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>. It is easy to compute the
likelihood of the innovations state space model <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:ss}\)</span>, and so obtain maximum
likelihood estimates. <span class="citation">J. K. Ord, Koehler, and
Snyder (1997)</span> show that <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\label{likelihood}
L^*(\bm\theta,\bm{x}_0) = n\log\Big(\sum_{t=1}^n
\varepsilon^2_t\Big) + 2\sum_{t=1}^n \log|r(\bm{x}_{t-1})|
\end{equation}\]</span> is equal to twice the negative logarithm of the
likelihood function (with constant terms eliminated), conditional on the
parameters <span class="math inline">\(\bm\theta =
(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\phi)'\)</span> and the initial states <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_0 =
(\ell_0,b_0,s_0,s_{-1},\dots,s_{-m+1})'\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of observations. This is
easily computed by simply using the recursive equations in Table <span class="math inline">\(\ref{table:pegels}\)</span>. Unlike state space
models with multiple sources of error, we do not need to use the Kalman
filter to compute the likelihood.</p>
<p>The parameters <span class="math inline">\(\bm\theta\)</span> and the
initial states <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_0\)</span> can be
estimated by minimizing <span class="math inline">\(L^*\)</span>. Most
implementations of exponential smoothing use an ad hoc heuristic scheme
to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_0\)</span>. However, with
modern computers, there is no reason why we cannot estimate <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_0\)</span> along with <span class="math inline">\(\bm\theta\)</span>, and the resulting forecasts
are often substantially better when we do.</p>
<p>We constrain the initial states <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_0\)</span> so that the seasonal indices add
to zero for additive seasonality, and add to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> for multiplicative seasonality. There
have been several suggestions for restricting the parameter space for
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. The traditional approach is to
ensure that the various equations can be interpreted as weighted
averages, thus requiring <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\beta^*=\beta/\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^*=\gamma/(1-\alpha)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to all lie within <span class="math inline">\((0,1)\)</span>. This suggests <span class="math display">\[0&lt;\alpha&lt;1,\qquad
0&lt;\beta&lt;\alpha,\qquad 0&lt;\gamma &lt;
1-\alpha,\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad 0&lt;\phi&lt;1.
\]</span> However, <span class="citation">Hyndman, Akram, and Archibald

necessary (although in a few cases they are not restrictive enough).</p>

<p>Forecast accuracy measures such as mean squared error (MSE) can be
used for selecting a model for a given set of data, provided the errors
are computed from data in a hold-out set and not from the same data as
were used for model estimation. However, there are often too few
out-of-sample errors to draw reliable conclusions. Consequently, a
penalized method based on the in-sample fit is usually better.</p>
<p>One such approach uses a penalized likelihood such as Akaike’s
Information Criterion: <span class="math display">\[\mbox{AIC} =
L^*(\hat{\bm\theta},\hat{\bm{x}}_0) + 2q,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the number of
parameters in <span class="math inline">\(\bm\theta\)</span> plus the
number of free states in <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_0\)</span>,
and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bm\theta}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\bm{x}}_0\)</span> denote the estimates of
<span class="math inline">\(\bm\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_0\)</span>. We select the model that
minimizes the AIC amongst all of the models that are appropriate for the
data.</p>
<p>The AIC also provides a method for selecting between the additive and
multiplicative error models. The point forecasts from the two models are
identical so that standard forecast accuracy measures such as the MSE or
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are unable to select between the
error types. The AIC is able to select between the error types because
it is based on likelihood rather than one-step forecasts.</p>
<p>Obviously, other model selection criteria (such as the BIC) could
also be used in a similar manner.</p>

<p>A common obstacle for many people in using Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA) models for forecasting is that the order
selection process is usually considered subjective and difficult to
apply. But it does not have to be. There have been several attempts to
automate ARIMA modelling in the last 25 years.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Hannan and Rissanen (1982)</span> proposed a
method to identify the order of an ARMA model for a stationary series.
In their method the innovations can be obtained by fitting a long
autoregressive model to the data, and then the likelihood of potential
models is computed via a series of standard regressions. They
established the asymptotic properties of the procedure under very
general conditions.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Gómez (1998)</span> extended the
Hannan-Rissanen identification method to include multiplicative seasonal
ARIMA model identification. <span class="citation">Gómez and Maravall
(1998)</span> implemented this automatic identification procedure in the
software and . For a given series, the algorithm attempts to find the
model with the minimum BIC.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Liu (1989)</span> proposed a method for
identification of seasonal ARIMA models using a filtering method and
certain heuristic rules; this algorithm is used in the software. Another
approach is described by <span class="citation">Mélard and Pasteels
(2000)</span> whose algorithm for univariate ARIMA models also allows
intervention analysis. It is implemented in the software package ``Time
Series Expert’’ ().</p>
<p>Other algorithms are in use in commercial software, although they are
not documented in the public domain literature. In particular, <span class="citation">(Goodrich 2000)</span> is well-known for its excellent
automatic ARIMA algorithm which was used in the M3-forecasting

<p>A non-seasonal ARIMA(<span class="math inline">\(p,d,q\)</span>)
process is given by <span class="math display">\[
\phi(B)(1-B^d)y_{t} = c + \theta(B)\varepsilon_t

is a white noise process with mean zero and variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the backshift operator, and <span class="math inline">\(\phi(z)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta(z)\)</span> are polynomials of order <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> respectively. To ensure causality and
invertibility, it is assumed that <span class="math inline">\(\phi(z)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta(z)\)</span> have no roots for <span class="math inline">\(|z|&lt;1\)</span> <span class="citation">(Brockwell and Davis 1991)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(c\ne0\)</span>, there is an implied polynomial of
order <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in the forecast
function.</p>
<p>The seasonal ARIMA<span class="math inline">\((p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m\)</span> process is given by
<span class="math display">\[
\Phi(B^m)\phi(B)(1-B^{m})^D(1-B)^dy_{t} = c +
\Theta(B^m)\theta(B)\varepsilon_t
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(z)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(z)\)</span> are polynomials of orders <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> respectively, each containing no roots
inside the unit circle. If <span class="math inline">\(c\ne0\)</span>,
there is an implied polynomial of order <span class="math inline">\(d+D\)</span> in the forecast function.</p>
<p>The main task in automatic ARIMA forecasting is selecting an
appropriate model order, that is the values <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> are known, we can select the orders
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> via an information criterion
such as the AIC: <span class="math display">\[\mbox{AIC} = -2\log(L) +
2(p+q+P+Q+k)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span> if
<span class="math inline">\(c\ne0\)</span> and 0 otherwise, and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the maximized likelihood of the
model fitted to the data <span class="math inline">\((1-B^m)^D(1-B)^dy_t\)</span>. The likelihood of
the full model for <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> is not
actually defined and so the value of the AIC for different levels of
differencing are not comparable.</p>
<p>One solution to this difficulty is the ``diffuse prior’’ approach
which is outlined in <span class="citation">Durbin and Koopman
(2001)</span> and implemented in the function <span class="citation">(Ripley 2002)</span> in . In this approach, the initial
values of the time series (before the observed values) are assumed to
have mean zero and a large variance. However, choosing <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> by minimizing the AIC using this
approach tends to lead to over-differencing. For forecasting purposes,
we believe it is better to make as few differences as possible because
over-differencing harms forecasts <span class="citation">(Smith and
Yadav 1994)</span> and widens prediction intervals. <span class="citation">(Although, see Hendry 1997 for a contrary
view.)</span></p>
<p>Consequently, we need some other approach to choose <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. We prefer unit-root tests. However,
most unit-root tests are based on a null hypothesis that a unit root
exists which biases results towards more differences rather than fewer
differences. For example, variations on the Dickey-Fuller test <span class="citation">(Dickey and Fuller 1981)</span> all assume there is a
unit root at lag 1, and the HEGY test of <span class="citation">Hylleberg et al. (1990)</span> is based on a null
hypothesis that there is a seasonal unit root. Instead, we prefer
unit-root tests based on a null hypothesis of no unit-root.</p>
<p>For non-seasonal data, we consider ARIMA(<span class="math inline">\(p,d,q\)</span>) models where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is selected based on successive KPSS
unit-root tests <span class="citation">(Kwiatkowski et al. 1992)</span>.
That is, we test the data for a unit root; if the test result is
significant, we test the differenced data for a unit root; and so on. We
stop this procedure when we obtain our first insignificant result.</p>
<p>For seasonal data, we consider ARIMA<span class="math inline">\((p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m\)</span> models where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the seasonal frequency and <span class="math inline">\(D=0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(D=1\)</span> depending on an extended
Canova-Hansen test <span class="citation">(Canova and Hansen
1995)</span>. Canova and Hansen only provide critical values for <span class="math inline">\(2&lt;m&lt;13\)</span>. In our implementation of
their test, we allow any value of <span class="math inline">\(m&gt;1\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(C_m\)</span> be the critical value for seasonal
period <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. We plotted <span class="math inline">\(C_m\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> for values of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> up to 365 and noted that they fit the
line <span class="math inline">\(C_m = 0.269 m^{0.928}\)</span> almost
exactly. So for <span class="math inline">\(m&gt;12\)</span>, we use
this simple expression to obtain the critical value.</p>
<p>We note in passing that the null hypothesis for the Canova-Hansen
test is not an ARIMA model as it includes seasonal dummy terms. It is a
test for whether the seasonal pattern changes sufficiently over time to
warrant a seasonal unit root, or whether a stable seasonal pattern
modelled using fixed dummy variables is more appropriate. Nevertheless,
we have found that the test is still useful for choosing <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> in a strictly ARIMA framework (i.e.,
without seasonal dummy variables). If a stable seasonal pattern is
selected (i.e., the null hypothesis is not rejected), the seasonality is
effectively handled by stationary seasonal AR and MA terms.</p>
<p>After <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is selected, we choose
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> by applying successive KPSS
unit-root tests to the seasonally differenced data (if <span class="math inline">\(D=1\)</span>) or the original data (if <span class="math inline">\(D=0\)</span>). Once <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> (and possibly <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>) are selected, we proceed to select the
values of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> by minimizing the AIC. We
allow <span class="math inline">\(c\ne0\)</span> for models where <span class="math inline">\(d+D &lt; 2\)</span>.</p>

<p>Suppose we have seasonal data and we consider ARIMA<span class="math inline">\((p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m\)</span> models where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> can take values from 0 to 3, and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> can take values from 0 to 1. When <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> there is a total of 288 possible
models, and when <span class="math inline">\(c\ne 0\)</span> there is a
total of 192 possible models, giving 480 models altogether. If the
values of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> are allowed to range more
widely, the number of possible models increases rapidly. Consequently,
it is often not feasible to simply fit every potential model and choose
the one with the lowest AIC. Instead, we need a way of traversing the
space of models efficiently in order to arrive at the model with the
lowest AIC value.</p>
We propose a step-wise algorithm as follows.
There are several constraints on the fitted models to avoid problems
with convergence or near unit-roots. The constraints are outlined below.
<p>The algorithm is guaranteed to return a valid model because the model
space is finite and at least one of the starting models will be accepted
(the model with no AR or MA parameters). The selected model is used to
produce forecasts.</p>

<p>There is a widespread myth that ARIMA models are more general than
exponential smoothing. This is not true. The two classes of models
overlap. The linear exponential smoothing models are all special cases
of ARIMA models—the equivalences are discussed in <span class="citation">Hyndman, Akram, and Archibald (2008)</span>. However,
the non-linear exponential smoothing models have no equivalent ARIMA
counterpart. On the other hand, there are many ARIMA models which have
no exponential smoothing counterpart. Thus, the two model classes
overlap and are complimentary; each has its strengths and
weaknesses.</p>
<p>The exponential smoothing state space models are all non-stationary.
Models with seasonality or non-damped trend (or both) have two unit
roots; all other models—that is, non-seasonal models with either no
trend or damped trend—have one unit root. It is possible to define a
stationary model with similar characteristics to exponential smoothing,
but this is not normally done. The philosophy of exponential smoothing
is that the world is non-stationary. So if a stationary model is
required, ARIMA models are better.</p>
<p>One advantage of the exponential smoothing models is that they can be
non-linear. So time series that exhibit non-linear characteristics
including heteroscedasticity may be better modelled using exponential
smoothing state space models.</p>
<p>For seasonal data, there are many more ARIMA models than the 30
possible models in the exponential smoothing class of Section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:expsmooth}\)</span>. It may be thought
that the larger model class is advantageous. However, the results in
<span class="citation">Hyndman et al. (2002)</span> show that the
exponential smoothing models performed better than the ARIMA models for
the seasonal M3 competition data. (For the annual M3 data, the ARIMA
models performed better.) In a discussion of these results, <span class="citation">Hyndman (2001)</span> speculates that the larger model
space of ARIMA models actually harms forecasting performance because it
introduces additional uncertainty. The smaller exponential smoothing
class is sufficiently rich to capture the dynamics of almost all real
business and economic time series.</p>

<p>There is another implementation of exponential smoothing in  via the
function <span class="citation">(Meyer 2002)</span> in the package. It
implements only the (N,N), (A,N), (A,A) and (A,M) methods. The initial
states <span class="math inline">\(\bm{x}_0\)</span> are fixed using a
heuristic algorithm. Because of the way the initial states are
estimated, a full three years of seasonal data are required to implement
the seasonal forecasts using . (See <span class="citation">Hyndman and
Kostenko (2007)</span> for the minimal sample size required.) The
smoothing parameters are optimized by minimizing the average squared
prediction errors, which is equivalent to minimizing <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{likelihood}\)</span> in the case of
additive errors.</p>
<p>There is a method for the resulting object which can produce point
forecasts and prediction intervals. Although it is nowhere documented,
it appears that the prediction intervals produced by for an object of
class are based on an equivalent ARIMA model in the case of the (N,N),
(A,N) and (A,A) methods, assuming additive errors. These prediction
intervals are equivalent to the prediction intervals that arise from the
(A,N,N), (A,A,N) and (A,A,A) state space models. For the (A,M) method,
the prediction interval provided by appears to be based on <span class="citation">Chatfield and Yar (1991)</span> which is an
approximation to the true prediction interval arising from the (A,A,M)
model. Prediction intervals with multiplicative errors are not possible
using the function.</p>

<p>The training set error measures for the two models are very similar.
Note that the information criteria are not comparable.</p>
<p>The package also contains the function which is largely a wrapper to
the function in the package. The function in the package makes it easier
to include a drift term when <span class="math inline">\(d+D=1\)</span>.
(Setting in the function from the package will only work when <span class="math inline">\(d+D=0\)</span>.) It also provides the facility for
fitting an existing ARIMA model to a new data set (as was demonstrated
for the function earlier).</p>
<p>One-step forecasts for ARIMA models are now available via a function.
We also provide a new function which returns the original time series
after adjusting for regression variables. If there are no regression
variables in the ARIMA model, then the errors will be identical to the
original series. If there are regression variables in the ARIMA model,
then the errors will be equal to the original series minus the effect of
the regression variables, but leaving in the serial correlation that is
modelled with the AR and MA terms. In contrast, provides true residuals,
removing the AR and MA terms as well.</p>
<p>The generic functions , , and apply to models obtained from either
the or functions.</p>

<h3 id="the-forecast-function">The forecast() function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-forecast-function"></a>
</h3>
<p>The function is generic and has S3 methods for a wide range of time
series models. It computes point forecasts and prediction intervals from
the time series model. Methods exist for models fitted using , , , , ,
and .</p>
<p>There is also a method for a object. If a time series object is
passed as the first argument to , the function will produce forecasts
based on the exponential smoothing algorithm of Section <span class="math inline">\(\ref{sec:expsmooth}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In most cases, there is an existing function which is intended to do
much the same thing. Unfortunately, the resulting objects from the
function contain different information in each case and so it is not
possible to build generic functions (such as and ) for the results. So,
instead, acts as a wrapper to , and packages the information obtained in
a common format (the class). We also define a default method which is
used when no existing function exists, and calls the relevant function.
Thus, methods parallel methods, but the latter provide consistent output
that is more usable.</p>
The output from the function is an object of class ``’’ and includes at
least the following information:
<p>There are , and methods for the ``’’ class. Figures <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:etsexamples}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:arimaexamples}\)</span> were produced
using the method.</p>
<p>The prediction intervals are, by default, computed for 80% and 95%
coverage, although other values are possible if requested. Fan charts
<span class="citation">(Wallis 1999)</span> are possible using the
combination .</p>

<h3 id="sec:other">Other functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec:other"></a>

<p>We now briefly describe some of the other features of the package.
Each of the following functions produces an object of class ``’’.</p>
<p>: implements the method of <span class="citation">Croston
(1972)</span> for intermittent demand forecasting. In this method, the
time series is decomposed into two separate sequences: the non-zero
values and the time intervals between non-zero values. These are then
independently forecast using simple exponential smoothing and the
forecasts of the original series are obtained as ratios of the two sets
of forecasts. No prediction intervals are provided because there is no
underlying stochastic model <span class="citation">(Shenstone and
Hyndman 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>: provides forecasts from the Theta method <span class="citation">(Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos 2000)</span>. <span class="citation">Hyndman and Billah (2003)</span> showed that these were
equivalent to a special case of simple exponential smoothing with
drift.</p>
<p>: gives cubic-spline forecasts, based on fitting a cubic spline to
the historical data and extrapolating it linearly. The details of this
method, and the associated prediction intervals, are discussed in <span class="citation">Hyndman, King, et al. (2005)</span>.</p>
<p>: returns forecasts based on the historical mean.</p>
<p>: gives ``naïve’’ forecasts equal to the most recent observation
assuming a random walk model. This function also allows forecasting
using a random walk with drift.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some new plotting functions for time
series.</p>
<p>: provides a time plot along with an ACF and PACF.</p>
<p>: produces a seasonal plot as described in <span class="citation">Spyros Makridakis, Wheelwright, and Hyndman
(1998)</span>.</p>
